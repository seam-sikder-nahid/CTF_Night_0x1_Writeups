# True Blue Trace

**Category:** Forensics

## Problem Description

We are given a file named `blue_fixed.bmp` with the hint *"Blue, Blue, Blue"*.  
The example flag format is `cscuu{xyz}`.
 
 **File:** ![file](../External_Folder/blue_fixed.bmp)
 
---

## Approach

I started by downloading and opening `blue_fixed.bmp`.  
The image looked mostly blue, but with several visible dots scattered throughout.  
Since this was a forensics challenge, my first step was to check for hidden metadata.

---

### Step 1: Metadata Analysis

I used `exiftool` to inspect the file’s metadata.

**What is exiftool?**  
`exiftool` is a command-line application for reading, writing, and editing metadata in a wide variety of files (images, videos, documents, etc.).  
It can reveal information such as camera details, timestamps, geotags, and sometimes even hidden messages.

**Command used:**
```bash
exiftool blue_fixed.bmp
```
---
The output didn’t reveal anything useful — no suspicious metadata fields were found.

---

### Step 2: Steganography Analysis

Since there was no metadata clue, I suspected hidden data within the image.
The hint "Blue, Blue, Blue" suggested that something might be embedded in the blue channel or using steganography.

I used the ``steghide`` tool to check for hidden files.

**What is steghide?**

``steghide`` is a steganography tool that can hide and extract data from image and audio files without changing the visible properties of the file.
It supports common formats like BMP and JPEG.

Command used:
```
steghide extract -sf blue_fixed.bmp
```
The tool asked for a passphrase.
The challenge description hinted that no password was needed, so I simply pressed Enter.

Boom! — The extraction worked, and I got a ``secret.txt`` text file containing the flag.

## Note:

**Alternative tools for this step include:**
    
 *`zsteg`*— useful for detecting hidden data in PNG/BMP images by analyzing pixel values.

 *`binwalk`*— often used for extracting embedded files from binary data.

---
## Conclusion

By checking the metadata first and then trying steganography extraction with steghide, I was able to retrieve the hidden message.
