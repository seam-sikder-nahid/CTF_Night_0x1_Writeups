### Answer: B

---

### Explanation:

The `uname -a` command prints detailed system information including the kernel version, which is essential for identifying vulnerabilities related to privilege escalation.

- `hostname` shows the systemâ€™s network name, not kernel info.  
- `whoami` displays the current username.  
- `lsmod` lists loaded kernel modules but does not show kernel version.

Knowing the exact kernel version helps attackers or security researchers find known exploits to escalate privileges.
