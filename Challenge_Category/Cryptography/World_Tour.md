### Problem Description:

One of our favourite musician Mr.X left us a message. Do you know what does that mean?

### Approach:

I read the problem and saw there was a file named `message.txt` attached. After downloading and opening it, I found the following message inside:

CSCUU{(0.3476, 32.5825)(13.7563, 100.5018)(39.9334, 32.8597)(-34.6037, -58.3816)(44.4268, 26.1025)(-35.2809, 149.1300)(50.4501, 30.5234)(27.7172, 85.3240)(28.6139, 77.2090)(21.0278, 105.8342)(30.0444, 31.2357)(-1.9706, 30.1044)(40.4168, -3.7038)(41.9028, 12.4964)(36.8065, 10.1815)(15.3694, 44.1910)}


At first, it looked like a series of latitude and longitude coordinates.


I opened Google Maps and searched for each coordinate pair, for example: `0.3476, 32.5825`. 

For each one, Google Maps showed the city and country at that location.I did this for all coordinate pairs listed in the message.
Then, I took the first letter of each country's name in order and arranged them.his spelled out the hidden flag.

**Here is the map showing locations as example(`0.3476 32.5825)`:**

| 15.3694   | 44.1910    | Sana'a       | Yemen       | Y      |


This was like Mr.X’s “world tour” represented by coordinates.

By decoding all the locations and extracting the initials, I was able to find the flag and solve the challenge.
