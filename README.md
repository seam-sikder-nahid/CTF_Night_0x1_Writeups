# CTF Night 0x1 — Writeups

This repository contains detailed, step-by-step writeups for challenges from **CTF Night 0x1!**, an **intra-university Capture The Flag competition** organized by the **Cyber Security Club, Uttara University**. This event was designed to test and enhance participants’ skills across various domains of information security, encouraging students to apply theoretical knowledge in practical, real-world-inspired scenarios.

The challenges in this CTF span multiple categories including **Web Exploitation, Forensics, Cryptography, Reverse Engineering, Binary Exploitation (Pwn), OSINT, and Miscellaneous**. Each writeup aims to not only demonstrate the final solution but also document the entire thought process, tools used, and alternative approaches considered during the solving phase.

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a **learning resource** for both beginners and experienced CTF players. Every challenge is broken down into **Reconnaissance, Vulnerability Identification, Exploitation, and Flag Retrieval** stages, making it easier for readers to understand the full exploitation chain. Whenever applicable, mitigation advice and security best practices are included to highlight how such vulnerabilities can be avoided in real-world systems.
